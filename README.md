## 🧠 About This Project

This project is part of my journey to become a data analyst. I wanted to explore real-world datasets and practice the core tools used in data analysis — especially Python, pandas, and Jupyter notebooks.

I chose population data because it's relevant, global, and easy to understand while still offering interesting insights. Through this project, I practiced:

- Loading and reading a real CSV dataset
- Exploring data using `pandas` methods like `.head()`, `.info()`, `.sort_values()`, and `.sum()`
- Cleaning and analyzing tabular data to extract meaningful trends

This project was completed using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and uploaded to GitHub using GitHub Desktop. It is my first complete public data project — and more are coming soon!
